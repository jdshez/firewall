# firewall
A recreation of a SonicWall firewall web site using HTML, SASS and Javascript with some GSAP animations. I really liked the design of the site so I took it and added some of my own touches which I feel improved it. I completely changed the hero section of the home page using a video background to give it more impact and encourage users to explore further.
